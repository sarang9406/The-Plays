  <strong>The Boys Next Door</strong> is a play written by <u>Tom Griffin</u> and frist produced in New York City in 1987. The story is about how four mentally disabled people and their social workers are living as a community.
  <h3>Characters</h3><p style="margin-top:10px;">There are 5 main characters in the play; Arnold Wiggins, Norman Bulansky, Lucien P. Smith, Barry Klemper and Jack Palmer.
  <strong>Arnold Wiggins</strong> is a man who lives with a mild mental disability who works at a movie theater as a janitor. He tends to be very obsessive compulsive.
  <strong>Norman Bulansky</strong> is a middle-aged man with mental disabilities who works at a doughnut shop. Eating doughnuts at his job has caused him to become overweight.
  <strong>Lucien P. Smith</strong> is a large African-American man who faces extremely debilitating mental disorders. Despite the fact that he cannot read, Smith insists on checking out armloads of books from the library.
  <strong>Barry Klemper</strong> is a 28-year-old man with schizophrenia who believes he is a pro golfer. He gets highly agitated over small things. This is partly because Barry has had a traumatic life growing up.
  <strong>Jack Palmer</strong> is the social worker for the four handicapped men.</p>

  Tom Griffin had an interview with the L.A. Times in 1993. When he was asked about the play's enduring appeal, the playwright surprisingly said,
  "If you ask me what the message of ths play is, I have'nt a clue."
  How could this be? The work has resonated with audiences for years - surely it would not be capable of maintaining such lasting appeal if there was not some universal truth that Griffin had tapped into, albeit unawares.
